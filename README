Yes,this is the new elvis(a vi clone)--nelvis.The elvis project haven't been
updated for a long time.I start this new elvis project .

The elvis's homepage is http://elvis.the-little-red-haired-girl.org.


The first things I need to do is to mantain the code.The old code support DOS,
OS2,Unix and Windows platforms(here I diffirentiate arch for hardware and
platform for software). Since I only have Unix here(Debian, Gentoo, Mageia,
FreeBSD and NetBSD),so I don't ensure the  code I write  gonna support the 
other platforms(DOS, Windows and OS2).I make tag 2.2_1 to support the origin
code(older code I mean) but with minor modification to compile in the latest 
Linux Distros(the glibc2.10 has a getline() function in stdio.h, that's the
problem).

Notes:
1. Though compiled sucessfully in Debian Wheezy(testing),but it cannot start 
regularlly from  common line.     

    The error message may be like this:

    Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
    Serial number of failed request:  144
